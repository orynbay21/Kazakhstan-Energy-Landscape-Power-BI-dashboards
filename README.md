## Detailed Description:

#### Page 1: Kazakhstan: one of the most energy-intensive economies in the world.
This page focuses on Kazakhstan's energy landscape, highlighting its energy intensity and GDP trends over the years.   
The inclusion of a **country and year Slicers** allows users to **explore different countries and timeframes.**

1. **Interactive World Map - Energy Intensity:**
The interactive world map provides a comparative overview of Kazakhstan's energy intensity against other countries, offering insights into its position in the global energy landscape.

3. **Line Chart - Energy Intensity by Year:**
This chart tracks Kazakhstan's energy intensity trends over time, allowing users to observe fluctuations and identify potential patterns or trends.
Since 1995 till 2015 our energy intensity was rapidly falling. However from 2015 till 2020 it was actually increasing. According to Enerdataat the end of 2020, Kazakhstan
entered the top ten most energy-intensive economies in the world.
5. **Line Chart - GDP over the Years:**
 By comparing GDP trends with energy intensity, users can discern the relationship between economic development and energy consumption.

7. **Line Chart - Energy Consumption by Energy Sources:**
This chart breaks down energy consumption by various sources, including fossil fuels, coal, gas, oil, hydro, solar, wind, and other renewables.
As we can see Kazakhstan's main energy sources are Coal, Fossil, Oil and Gas. Renewable Energy consumption is so negligible that its lines merge with the X-axis on the chart.

**Page 2: Transition to renewable energy and electricity generation trends**
This page explores the transition to renewable energy and electricity generation trends globally and within Kazakhstan.

1. **MAP - Share of Primary Energy Consumption from Renewable Sources:** The map illustrates the global distribution of primary energy consumption from renewable sources.
For example, Kazakhstan's share of primary energy consumption in 2018 is 1.7%, while Canada's share is 26.8%. It provides context for Kazakhstan's renewable energy initiatives.

3. **Line and Stacked Column Chart - Electricity Generation from Renewables vs. Carbon Intensity:**
Demonstrates the trade-off between renewable energy adoption and carbon emissions reduction, highlighting potential pathways for sustainable energy development.For instance, from 2010 till 2016 more and more electricity is being generated from renewables and consequently, carbon intensity inevitably goes down.

5. **Area Chart - Total Electricity Generated vs. Electricity Generated by Renewable Resources:**
The area chart compares total electricity generation with electricity generated from renewable resources.
For example:

7. **Line Chart - Electricity Generated by Energy Source:** This chart provides a detailed breakdown of electricity generation by different energy sources. Which follows the same trends as overall energy consumption by energy source.
## Q/A on Energy Terminology
According to Enerdata in 2020, Kazakhstan entered the top 10 most energy-intensive economies in the world.  

**What does 'Energy-Intensity' mean?**  

The energy intensity of a country refers to the amount of energy required to produce one unit of gross domestic product (GDP). A low energy intensity indicates that the country can produce goods and services with relatively lower energy consumption per unit of GDP.   

**How could Kazakhstan fix its energy-intensity?**    

One of the ways is to integrate renewable energy sources into our energy mix as these sources tend to be more environmentally friendly and efficient.  

**What does 'Primary Energy' mean?**   

Energy of fossil fuels, solar radiation, or nuclear fuels, which are all primary, can be converted into other energy forms such as electricity and heat that are more useful to us. All energy that has been subjected to human-made transformation is secondary energy.   

**What is 'Carbon Intensity'?**  

The carbon intensity of electricity generation tells us how environmentally friendly or carbon-intensive a particular method of generating electricity is. Lower carbon intensity means less carbon dioxide emissions per unit of electricity produced, which is better for the environment and helps combat climate change.
